# Online Retail Data Clustering Project

This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to analyze online retail data. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior and other attributes. By clustering customers into groups, the project aims to provide valuable insights that could inform marketing strategies, product recommendations, and overall business decision-making.


## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Online Retail II** dataset, which can be downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii).
